# Taxi-Trip-Duration-NYC
  In this project, yudha takes data from Keggle. yudha uses the regression method in modeling this project. the purpose of this project is to provide information to users on how long it takes users to get from the starting point to the point they want.
  
  The purpose of this project is to be able to provide an estimate of how long it will take the user to reach the desired destination. It is hoped that this modeling will provide user considerations in using taxi services and the biggest impact from a business actor perspective is being able to make efficient use of which fleet has the shortest distance and estimated time to pick up customers from the taxi stop point to the customer pick-up point.

  The conclusion from this project is that I use the regression method and I apply it to 5 models, namely:
        1. Decision Tree
        2. Random Forest
        3. There is Boost
        4. Improved Gradient
        5. XGBoost
  Of these five models, the Decision Tree model has the best efficiency and accuracy, with an r2_score value of 99% and has an error of only 3 seconds and is   the most efficient in terms of processing compared to the others.
